# captppd
[![Core tests](https://github.com/darkvision77/captppd/actions/workflows/core-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/darkvision77/captppd/actions/workflows/core-tests.yml)

CUPS driver for Canon CAPT v1 printers based on reverse engineering of the original driver. \
Implemented as a CUPS backend using libusb.

The driver is divided into two parts: the CUPS side (this repository)
and the protocol side ([libcapt](https://github.com/darkvision77/libcapt)).

## Target devices
| Model   | Cartridge     | PPM (A4) | Max Resolution | Year (approx.) |
|---------|---------------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| LBP800  | EP-22         | 8        | 600 dpi        | 1999-2001      |
| LBP810  | EP-22         | 8        | 600 dpi        | 2001-2002      |
| LBP1120 | EP-22         | 10       | 600 dpi        | 2003-2004      |
| LBP1210 | EP-25         | 14       | 600 dpi        | ~2002          |
| LBP3200 | EP-26/EP-27   | 18       | 600 dpi        | 2004-2006      |

## Status
| Feature                    | Status          |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| 600 DPI                    | SUPPORTED       |
| 300 DPI                    | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| Custom media size          | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
| Borderless printing        | SUPPORTED*      |
| Multi-page jobs            | SUPPORTED       |
| Cleaning                   | SUPPORTED       |
| Toner saving               | SUPPORTED       |
| Toner density              | SUPPORTED       |
| Media type selection       | SUPPORTED       |
| Automatic Image Refinement | SUPPORTED       |

\* *The hardware cannot print ~4 mm from the top anyway.*

At the moment, the protocol is quite well known.
The raster format (SCoA compression algorithm) is also well known and,
theoretically, is completely reliable.

## Compilation
### Dependencies
#### Compile-time
- gcc >= 11 or clang >= 16
- cmake >= 3.21
- git
- python3
- [libcapt](https://github.com/darkvision77/libcapt) >= 1.0 (downloaded automatically by CMake FetchContent)

#### Run-time
- cups
- libusb-1.0

### Compile
```sh
cmake -S. -B build
cmake --build build
```

### Install
This command will install the backend, PPD files, and quirks
that prevent Canon CAPT v1 printers from being detected by the CUPS USB backend:
```sh
cmake --install build
```

If you don't want to blacklist Canon CAPT v1 printers for the CUPS USB backend, you can use:
```sh
cmake --install build --component=base
```

## Usage
### Adding printer from command line
1. List devices:
```sh
lpinfo -v

# Example output
direct usb://Canon/LBP3200?serial=00000000
direct captusb://Canon/LBP3200?drv=capt&serial=00000000
```

2. Copy captusb URI and add printer using lpadmin:
```sh
lpadmin -p LBP3200 -E -v 'captusb://Canon/LBP3200?drv=capt&serial=00000000' -m LBP3200CAPTPPD.ppd
```

3. Verify with lpstat:
```sh
lpstat -v

# Example output
device for LBP3200: captusb://Canon/LBP3200?drv=capt&serial=00000000
```

### Adding printer from user interface
#### CUPS web interface
1. Go to admin page (default: http://127.0.0.1:631/admin).
2. Click “Find New Printers”.
3. Select the captusb printer.
4. And the model should be like `Canon LBP3200, captppd 0.1.0`.

## Troubleshooting
### If the printer has not been detected
1. Make sure that your printer is displayed in the `lsusb` output.
2. Execute the backend directly:
```sh
sudo $(cups-config --serverbin)/backend/captusb
```
3. If the backend couldn't detect the printer, [create an issue](https://github.com/darkvision77/captppd/issues/new).

### If the printer is not working
1. Check `lpstat -v` and make sure that the `captusb` backend is being used.
2. Make sure you are using the correct PPD (should be like `Canon LBP3200, captppd 0.1.0`, not `Canon LBP3200 CAPT ver.1.5`).
3. Enable CUPS debug logging:
```sh
cupsctl --debug-logging
```
4. See logs at `/var/log/cups/error_log`. \
To filter out unwanted messages, you can use grep:
```sh
grep '\] \[Job' /var/log/cups/error_log
```
5. [Create an issue](https://github.com/darkvision77/captppd/issues/new) and attach the log.
